# RL_Project_TradIT

The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To simulate a microgrid environment that includes renewable energy sources, energy storage, and backup generators.
2. To implement and compare different energy management strategies using Reinforcement Learning algorithms (Q-Learning, Deep Q-Learning, World Model) and a rule-based approach.
3. To optimize energy costs and enhance sustainability by making intelligent decisions based on current system states.
4. To develop a user-friendly simulation interface using Streamlit for real-time interaction and visualization of results.
5. To evaluate the performance of each agent by measuring rewards, costs, and stabilization in the learning process.
